4.  Once opened unzip/extract all files in the ZIP file.

#### Guide to running the R Markdown files and R scripts:

1.  Start by opening the 2023_MSc_Spatial_Course.RProj file in your documents browser. Only continue if in the top right corner of your RStudio session you see the text 2023_MSc_Spatial_Course. If you see this, you have successfully opened the .RProj file. If you do not see this, go File --\> Open Project --\> Navigate to and select the .RProj file.
2.  In your R Studio session, open the 'Files' tab.

There are two ways to run your code. Either through the .R scripts or the .RMD Rmarkdown documents.

##### To run the .R scripts:

3.  Open the scripts folder. Then start by running the 0_Install_packages.R script. Then sequentially complete scripts 1 and 2.
4.  Once the .R script is open, click the 'Run' button at the top of your screen.

##### To run the .RMD Rmarkdown documents:

3.  Open the RMDs folder, then open your chosen tutorial
4.  Once the .Rmd file is open, click the 'Knit' button at the top of your screen.
5.  This will show you an immediate html output and save an html document to your html folder.

#### Folder structure:

-   data - environmental variables (worldclim.tif) and all protected areas for Madagascar
-   html - annotated tutorials for sessions 1 and 2
-   images - ignore: used for enriching the annotated tutorials
-   output - ignore: all of your outputs should be in html format
-   RMDs - R markdown documents used to create the annotated html tutorials
-   scripts - clean scripts, which mirror the code used in the R markdown documents and those seen in the annotated tutorials. If you find it easier, use these as a playground to test your code and then copy and paste the sections into your 3_Student_Report_Template.Rmd document.
-   slides - the PowerPoint slides used to provide background context for each session.

#### Assignment:

Please find the word document, MSc_SA_Assessment.docx for details on the assignment.

**You are required to submit your assignment as an .html file.**

This will be the default output setting of your RMarkdown document.
